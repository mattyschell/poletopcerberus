## Poletop Cerberus

### Description

In late 2018 the legacy poletop application appeared to exhibit inexplicable and
very troubling buggy behavior.  Usually from the user perspective this meant 
something like creating a new reservation and having the entered reservation 
details being applied to an existing, unrelated reservation.

The goal of the code in this repo is to, as pro-actively as possible, capture
such misbehavior as it happens and report the infractions to the poletop 
support team (if one exists).
